<h1>Humans verses Zombies: Mizzou Style</h1>
<br />
(last update, March 18th, 2010)
<br />
<br />
<div>Humans vs. Zombies is a week long, 24/7 game of tag.  All players begin as humans, and one or more is randomly chosen to be the "Original Zombie."  The Original Zombie tags human players and turns them into zombies.  The zombie must tag and "feed" on a human every 48 hours or he/she starves to death and is out of the game. As a human, you can be tagged at any time when you are outside. Be aware of your surroundings! The game always begins at MIDNIGHT on the first day of the game.</div>
<br />
<div>If you have not already registered, go do so now (at <a href="http://mizzou.hvzsource.com/register.php">muzombies.org</a>). Make sure to write your ID number on an index card (Make sure to do so accurately!). <span style='color: red; font-weight: bold'> (NEW)</span> Also, write your name on the backside. This ID card helps keep track of who is a human and who is a zombie.</div>
<br />
<div>Humans vs. Zombies is an official organization now at Mizzou!</div>
<br />
<br />
<div><span style='color: red; font-weight: bold'>(NEW)</span> THE GOLDEN RULE OF HUMANS VS. ZOMBIES IS: <b>DON'T BE A DICK</b>.</div>
<br />
<div>Trust us, the game isn't fun if players become dicks. We've seen it happen every semester. We'll try to moderate a fair game, but in the end it's the players who make the game.</div>
<br />
<div><span style='color: red; font-weight: bold'>(NEW)</span> THE SILVER RULE OF HUMANS VS. ZOMBIES IS: <b>BE A SMART PLAYER</b>.</div>
<br />
<div>The rules here are not overly complicated, please read through them and email us if you have any concerns. There should be very few times you should need to call the HvZ Help Line (see below). Try to sort out problems amongst yourselves.</div>

<br />
<br />
<UL>
<LI>

</UL>
<br />
<OL>

<div>  
<span style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;'>HUMANS</span>
<br />
<br />  
  Objective: Survive the game, and complete missions in order to ensure your survival.
<br />
<br />
<OL>  
<LI><span style='color: red; font-weight: bold'>(NEW)</span> Humans must wear a bandana around THEIR UPPER ARM to indicate they are playing. This should be worn at all times when you are outside/taggable.
<LI>Make sure you are carrying your CORRECT ID card with your number at all times. You will hand this over to the zombie in the event you are tagged. If there is a conflict, call us at the HvZ Help Line (see below) but realize we may decide to flip and coin to decide your fate or immediately decide to zombify you.
<LI>In the event you are tagged, you must wait 10 minutes before you are allowed to tag anyone as a zombie. Move your armband to your neck (ie, stunned zombie) for 10 minutes. Then you may move it to your forehead and proceed with tagging 30 seconds after your headband is around your head (see ZOMBIES section below).
<LI>If you have not been marked as zombie within THREE (3) HOURS of being tagged, contact the HvZ Help Line (see below). You will remain a human, and will get a new ID. Note, any kills you got during those 3 hours STILL COUNT and their IDs should be given to the moderator when you call. 
<LI>Getting tagged on your backpack is NOT a valid tag.
<LI>Getting tagged on your weapon is NOT a valid tag.
<LI>Humans may not be tagged while inside safe zones (see SAFE ZONES below)
<LI><span style='color: red; font-weight: bold'>(NEW)</span> Humans may shoot and stun zombies from both safe and non-safe zones. The stun time is the same.
<LI>Humans may be tagged while off campus (such as walking around downtown)! However you are safe inside buildings off campus as usual. Please be respectful of others and their property when off campus.
</OL>
<br />
<br />
<div>
<span style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;'>ZOMBIES</span>
<br />
<br />
  Objective: Tag and devour as many humans as possible. Your goal is complete and utter zombification. Prevent humans from succeeding on missions.
<br />
<br />
<UL>
<LI>  
  HEADBANDS:
</UL>
<OL>  
<LI>A zombie must wear a bandana around their heads (ninja-style) for the duration of the game. Excluding when they are at work/practice.
<LI><span style='color: red; font-weight: bold'>(NEW)</span> Headbands must be worn around your forehead FOR AT LEAST 30 SECONDS before you may actually tag a human! (Such as moving it back after you are unstunned, or after putting it on for the first time). Tags may be invalidated if this rule is not followed.
<LI><span style='color: red; font-weight: bold'>(NEW)</span> Zombies may not use techniques to disguise their bandana. It must be clearly visible from a 50+ feet away. This means, do not hide your bandana under your hair, in a banana suit, or otherwise. Moderators reserve the right to invalidate tags if we feel your bandana was not clear enough!
<LI>IMPORTANT, the Original Zombie(s) do not need to wear a bandana around their head for the first 24 hours of the game.  The Original Zombie(s) will have a moderator signed index card that indicates they are the Original Zombie.  After the 24 hours the original zombie must wear the bandana around their head.
</OL>
<br />
<UL>
<LI>  
  BEING STUNNED:
</UL>
<OL>
<LI>When shot with a Nerf gun or hit with a sock/nerf dart (throwing Nerf darts is allowed), a zombie is stunned for 10 minutes. A stunned zombie may not interact with the game in any way.
<LI>Zombies are considered stunned if they maliciously pick up ammunition of humans. You may pick up darts to compile or throw them back to humans HOWEVER if a human requests you give him/her a dart which belongs to them, and you do not comply, you are considered stunned. So, best case is to just leave ammo on the ground.
<LI><span style='color: red; font-weight: bold'>(NEW)</span> Note, during missions, zombies will have respawn points instead of stun timers. You will need to visit a respawn point to become unstunned. This includes being stunned while the human is inside a safe zone.
<LI>When stunned, do NOT shield other zombies, follow humans, communicate with fellow zombies, etc. Move 20 feet away from the nearest player to ensure this. Moderators may remove you from the game if you do not follow this rule.
<LI>When stunned, move your headband around your neck to indicate you are stunned. Move it back after you are unstunned.
<LI>Head shots count! You are stunned if hit in the head by a Nerf Dart/Sock.
<LI>If a zombie swats/catches socks/darts, they are stunned.
</OL>
<br />
<UL>
<LI>  
  TAGGING HUMANS:
</UL>
<OL>
<LI><span style='color: red; font-weight: bold'>(NEW)</span> When a zombie tags a human, collect their ID Card. If there is dispute over a rule, you may use the HvZ Help Line for clarification. Otherwise, please work it out amongst yourselves.
<LI><span style='color: red; font-weight: bold'>(NEW)</span></span> A zombie may only tag TWO humans at a time (ie, one for each hand). During a mission, you may tag again after you collect the ID cards from the zombies (make sure to register the kills on the website within 3 hours!). When missions are not happening, zombies may only carry TWO ID cards at any given time (you need to register them on the website before getting more kills!). Call the HvZ Help Line (see below) if you are not near a computer.
<LI>Zombies have THREE (3) HOURS to report kills through the website. If you cannot make it to a computer, call the HvZ Help Line (see below) and we can report the kill for you.
<LI>If you do not report a kill within 3 hours, the player will remain human.
<LI>Zombies must get a tag (feed) every 48 hours to remain alive! This is regulated by the online system. If you become deceased, any tags you get after the fact will be invalidated.

<div>
<span style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;'>SAFE ZONES</span>
<br />
<br />
  Safe zones are places and scenarios where humans may not be tagged and turned into a zombie. They include:
<br />
<br />
<OL>
<LI>Inside any building (res hall, rec center, library, dining hall, etc).
<LI>Inside any building off campus.
<LI>Attending any class (including outdoor classes, class ends when the instructor dismisses).
<LI>When a human has two feet inside any safe zone (even if they are leaning outside of the safe zone, see below SPECIAL NOTE AROUND DOORS)
<LI><span style='color: red; font-weight: bold'>(NEW)</span> Inside parking garages and inside cars during the day. (Note: parking garages are off limits during missions)
</OL>
<br />
<UL>
<LI>
  SPECIAL NOTE AROUND DOORS:
</UL>
<OL>
<LI> 
  Doors have been a considerable problem in the past. As a human, you are safe for 5 seconds once you touch a door handle. This allows you to get through the door safely. If you are not inside within 5 seconds, you may be tagged. You may not "re touch" the door handle to gain another 5 seconds.
<LI><span style='color: red; font-weight: bold'>(NEW)</span> You must have BOTH feet inside the building to be considered safe. If any part of your body touches the ground outside the building, you may be tagged until both feet are grounded again inside the building. 
<LI>As a human, when coming out of the building, you are safe for 5 seconds or 5 feet, whichever comes first.
<LI>Zombies may not enter buildings during missions.
</OL>
<br />
<UL>
<LI>
  SPECIAL NOTE AROUND PARKING GARAGES:
</UL>
<OL>
<LI>
  As noted, parking garages are safe zones during the day (consider them a building) and off limits during missions for security reasons. Parking garages don't have well defined "exits", but imagine an imaginary plane across the openings. If any part of your body touches the ground outside the plane, you may be tagged.
</OL>
</div>
<br />
<br />

<div>
<span style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;'>MISSIONS</span>
<br />
<br />
  Missions are necessary to get humans out of buildings, and to make the game more fun.
<br />
<br />
  Mission details will be released closer to game time, but be aware there will likely be a mission EVERY DAY! Attendance will not be taken before or after missions, however there will be very clear, defined, winning conditions for the humans. In other words, you will know exactly what you need to do to survive the week of HvZ. The game may end before a week if humans are unable to complete the required missions!
<br />
<br />
  Humans may not leave the following square area when formal missions are happening:
  <br />
  College/Stadium/Providence/Elm-University
  <br />
  A mission will be failed if humans are found to have left this area with objectives.
<br />
<br />
Zombies may not enter buildings during missions.
<br />
<br />
  In many cases, humans will have a starting point and time via email and facebook. At this location and time, there will be a ring of orange cones. Humans are safe inside this ring, and cannot be tagged while inside the ring.

<div>
<span style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;'>SPECIAL CASES</div>
<br />
<OL>
<LI>People who are not registered to participate  may not interact with the game in any way. This includes bringing food to humans, spying/passing ANY information to either team, etc.
<LI><span style='color: red; font-weight: bold'>(NEW)</span> If a kill is not reported within 3 hours, that player remains human. They will be assigned a new ID. Contact the HvZ Help Line (see below) to get your new ID. Note, any kills this human got during the 3 hours STILL COUNT and should be given to the moderator while receiving your new ID. This rule is simply to make sure we don't start a chain reaction of people calling the Help Line asking for new IDs (because we have a limited amount of new ones).
<LI>Problematic players will be banned from the game for the rest of the semester, and their names may be reported to MU.
